name: Social Security Administration
description: The United States Social Security Administration (SSA)[2] is an independent
  agency of the United States federal government that administers Social Security,
  a social insurance program consisting of retirement, disability, and survivors benefits.
  To qualify for these benefits, most American workers pay Social Security taxes on
  their earnings; future benefits are based on the employees contributions. The Social
  Security Administration was established by a law codified at 42 U.S.C. sect; 901.
  Its current commissioner, Carolyn W. Colvin (Acting), was sworn in on February 14,
  2013, succeeding Michael J. Astrue.
