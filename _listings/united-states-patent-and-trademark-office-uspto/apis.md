name: United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
description: The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or USPTO) is an agency
  in the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and businesses
  for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and intellectual property
  identification. The USPTO is unique among federal agencies because it operates solely
  on fees collected by its users, and not on taxpayer dollars. Its operating structure
  is like a business in that it receives requests for services???applications for
  patents and trademark registrations???and charges fees projected to cover the cost
  of performing the services it provides.
